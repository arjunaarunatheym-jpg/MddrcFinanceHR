## January 11, 2026 - Finance Dashboard Year Filter & Credit Note Workflow

### Year-by-Year Filter for Finance Dashboard (P1 - COMPLETED)
- **Problem**: Finance Dashboard showed all invoices/data regardless of year; user couldn't filter by financial year
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `Financial Year` dropdown selector in Finance Dashboard
  - Backend `/api/finance/dashboard` and `/api/finance/invoices` endpoints now accept `?year=YYYY` parameter
  - Dashboard cards (Total Invoices, Collected, Outstanding, Payables) filter by selected year
  - Invoices tab also filters by selected year
  - Year selector always shows current year ± 2 years (e.g., 2024, 2025, 2026) plus any years with data
  - "Showing data for YYYY" indicator displays selected year
- **Files Modified**: `backend/server.py`, `frontend/src/pages/FinanceDashboard.jsx`

### Credit Note Workflow Enhancement (P1 - COMPLETED)
- **Problem**: Credit Notes were created as "draft" and never issued; no print/download functionality
- **Solution**:
  - Added status workflow: Draft → Approved → Issued (same as Invoices)
  - New API endpoints:
    - `POST /api/finance/credit-notes/{cn_id}/approve` - Approve a draft CN
    - `POST /api/finance/credit-notes/{cn_id}/issue` - Issue a CN (can skip approve)
  - Credit Notes tab now shows:
    - Date column
    - Status badges (Draft=Yellow, Approved=Blue, Issued=Green)
    - Actions column with:
      - Approve button (for draft CNs)
      - Issue button (for draft/approved CNs)
      - Print button (opens print preview)
      - Download button (opens print for PDF save)
  - **Auto-Issue on Payment**: When recording a payment with CN checkbox, the Credit Note is now automatically issued

    - CN details (number, date, invoice reference)
    - Reason/description section
    - Amount displayed prominently
    - Status badge
    - Footer with company info
- **Files Modified**: `backend/server.py`, `frontend/src/pages/FinanceDashboard.jsx`


### Credit Note Management in Data Tab (P1 - COMPLETED)
- **Problem**: Credit Notes had no editing capabilities like Invoices; no backdate, void, or audit trail
- **Solution**:
  - Added new **Credit Notes** tab in Data Management (between Invoices and Payments)
  - Backend endpoints added:
    - `PUT /api/finance/admin/credit-notes/{cn_id}/backdate` - Change CN date with reason
    - `PUT /api/finance/admin/credit-notes/{cn_id}/edit` - Edit details with reason
    - `PUT /api/finance/admin/credit-notes/{cn_id}/void` - Void CN with reason
    - `PUT /api/finance/admin/credit-notes/{cn_id}/number` - Change CN number with reason
  - All changes logged to Audit Trail with:
    - Action type (Backdated, Edited, Voided, Number Changed)

  - Added useEffect to auto-load payments when Payments tab is activated
- **Files Modified**: `backend/server.py`, `frontend/src/pages/FinanceDashboard.jsx`

### Admin Finance Tab Year Filter (P1 - COMPLETED)
- **Problem**: Admin Dashboard's Finance tab showed all-time invoices without year filtering
- **Solution**:
  - Added `financeYear` state and year selector dropdown
  - Created `loadFinanceSummaryByYear()` function that calls `/api/finance/dashboard?year=YYYY`
  - Dashboard cards now filter by selected year
  - Year selector shows current year ± 2 years
- **Files Modified**: `frontend/src/pages/AdminDashboard.jsx`

### Payables Print Feature (P1 - COMPLETED)

- **Problem**: No way to export payables to Excel format; no period closing to prevent changes
- **Solution**:

**1. Excel Export Feature**
  - Added `GET /api/finance/payables/export-excel?year=YYYY&month=MM` endpoint
  - Returns data grouped by staff name with session details
  - Columns: NAME, INVOICE NUMBER, TRAINING DATE, POSITION, COMPANY, DETAILS, PRICE
  - Includes subtotals per person and grand total
  - Exports as CSV file (opens in Excel)
  - Data comes from same endpoints trainers/coordinators/marketing see in their portals

**2. Period Management (Open/Close)**

## January 11, 2026 - P0 Bug Fix & P&L Enhancement

### P0: Re-open Period Dialog Fix (COMPLETED)
- **Problem**: The "Reopen" button for locked Pay Advice periods used `window.prompt()` which:
  - Doesn't work on mobile browsers
  - Is a poor UX (native browser dialog)
  - Was inconsistent with the rest of the app's modal dialogs
- **Solution**:
  - Replaced `window.prompt()` in `HRModule.jsx` with a proper Shadcn `Dialog` component
  - Added state: `unlockPayAdviceDialog` with `{open, id, reason}`
  - Created `confirmUnlockPayAdvice()` handler that validates reason (min 5 chars) before API call
  - Dialog includes: title, description, textarea for reason, Cancel/Unlock buttons
  - Same pattern already used in `FinanceDashboard.jsx` for Payables period reopen
- **Files Modified**: `frontend/src/components/HRModule.jsx`

### P&L Enhancement: CEO P&L View & Sub-ledger Reports (COMPLETED)
- **Problem**: User wanted programme-level P&L breakdown matching their Excel template with:
  - Dynamic income/expense breakdown by programme
  - Sub-ledger views for Trainers, Marketing, Payroll
  - CEO-style insight view with margins

- **Solution - Backend Endpoints Added**:
  - `GET /api/finance/profit-loss/by-programme?year=YYYY` - Programme-level P&L with:
    - Revenue per programme (linked via sessions → invoices)
    - Direct costs per programme (trainer fees, coordinator fees, marketing, session expenses)
    - Gross profit and margin % per programme
    - Overhead costs (payroll, petty cash, manual) shown separately
    - Summary with net profit and net margin %
  
  - `GET /api/finance/subledger/trainers?year=YYYY` - Trainer & Coordinator Sub-ledger:
    - Aggregated by person (earned, paid, balance)
    - Session-level detail with dates, programme, amounts, status
  
  - `GET /api/finance/subledger/marketing?year=YYYY` - Marketing Commission Sub-ledger:
    - Aggregated by marketer
    - Client/campaign detail with commission rates
  
  - `GET /api/finance/subledger/payroll?year=YYYY` - Staff Payroll Register:
    - Aggregated by employee
    - Monthly breakdown with gross, EPF, SOCSO, EIS, net

- **Solution - Frontend (ProfitLossLedger.jsx)**:
  - **New Tabs Added**:
    - "CEO P&L" - Programme breakdown table with expandable rows for cost detail
    - "Trainers" - Trainer & Coordinator sub-ledger with expandable session detail
    - "Marketing" - Marketing commission sub-ledger with client detail
    - "Payroll" - Staff payroll register with monthly breakdown
  - **Features**:
    - Expandable rows (click to see detail)
    - Color-coded margins (green >30%, yellow 15-30%, red <15%)
    - Summary cards showing totals and overhead breakdown
    - Year selector (dynamic data loading)

- **Files Modified**: 
  - `backend/server.py` - Added 4 new endpoints
  - `frontend/src/components/ProfitLossLedger.jsx` - Complete rewrite with new tabs

### Key Architecture Notes
- **No new database collections** - All new endpoints aggregate existing data from:
  - `db.programs` - Programme definitions
  - `db.sessions` - Sessions with `program_id` field
  - `db.invoices` - Invoice amounts
  - `db.trainer_fees`, `db.coordinator_fees`, `db.marketing_commissions` - Direct costs
  - `db.session_expenses` - F&B, venue costs
  - `db.hr_payslips` - Payroll data
  - `db.petty_cash_transactions`, `db.manual_expenses` - Overhead

- **Dynamic Programme Support**: New programmes automatically appear in CEO P&L when sessions are created with that `program_id`
